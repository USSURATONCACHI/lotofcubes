# LotofCubes

Welcome to **LotofCubes**! This project is a 3D prototype of a Minecraft-like game, serving as an experimental platform for exploring 3D graphics and texture loading techniques. As a pre-alpha work-in-progress, LotofCubes is continuously evolving with new features and improvements.

## Features

- **3D Environment**: Basic 3D world terrain.
- **Texture Loading**: Experimentation with various texture loading techniques.
- **Voxel-Based System**: Prototype for a voxel-based world, akin to Minecraft.
